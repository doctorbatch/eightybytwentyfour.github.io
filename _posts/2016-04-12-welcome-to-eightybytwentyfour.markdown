Welcome to Eighty by Twenty-Four (80x24), a mainframe focused blog from <a href="http://zblservices.com">ZBL</a>'s <a href="http://tim.fanel.li">Tim Fanelli</a>. This 
blog is focused on performing various tasks on the IBM z/OS Operating System, mainframe events and conferences, and other z/OS related news

Those of you unfamiliar with the mainframe may ask: "What is 80x24?" - so a brief bit of context on the site name. One of the most successful terminals used to 
connect to the IBM Mainframe system was the IBM 3278 Model 2, which was an 80-column by 24-row display. 

There were 5 models in the 3278 family, and the 3278 itself was just one in a series of terminals using the 3270 protocol. 3270 implemented high-speed communications 
via coaxial cable using "datastreams" of bulk-information, as opposed to communicating character-by-character. 

To this day, most mainframe operators and application developers still use IBM 3270 to connect to the z/OS Operating System, though the physical terminals have largely (if not completely) been replaced by the use of terminal emulating software.
